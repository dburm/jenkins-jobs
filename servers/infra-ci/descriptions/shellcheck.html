<p>ShellCheck is a GPLv3 tool that gives warnings and suggestions for bash/sh shell scripts:</p>

<p>The goals of ShellCheck are</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues
        that cause a shell to give cryptic error messages.</p></li>
    <li><p>To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems
        that cause a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.</p></li>
    <li><p>To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls that may cause an
        advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>

    the gallery of bad code</a> for examples of what ShellCheck can help you identify!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki">Shellcheck Wiki page</a>
    for additional information about found syntax issues and how to fix them.</p>

<p>In case you 100% sure that shellcheck has false-negative warning, then you may ignore
    such warnings using <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore">ignore</a> directive.</p>
